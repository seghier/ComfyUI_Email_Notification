## Step-by-Step Implementation with Gmail

1. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to your Google Account settings.
   - Navigate to "Security" and then "App passwords".
   - Choose "Mail" and "Other (custom name)".
   - Follow the prompts to generate a 16-character password.

2. **Enable Less Secure Apps** (Optional but not recommended for main accounts):
   - Go to your Google Account settings.
   - Navigate to "Security".
   - Turn on "Less secure app access".

3. **Install Necessary Libraries**:
   - Make sure you have `smtplib` and `email` libraries installed. If not, install them using pip:
     ```

     pip install email
     ```
     or
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
